# Implementation Plan

## Task

<!-- Task ID and brief description -->

## Objective

<!-- Single sentence: what the implementation achieves -->

## Prerequisites

<!-- Conditions that must be true before Step 1 begins -->
<!-- If none: "No prerequisites." -->

## Steps

### Step 1: [Action verb + target]

- **Dependencies:** [prior steps or "none"]
- **Success Criteria:** [measurable outcome]
- **Validation:** [how to verify this step is correct]

### Step 2: [Action verb + target]

- **Dependencies:** [Step 1]
- **Success Criteria:** [measurable outcome]
- **Validation:** [how to verify this step is correct]

<!-- Continue for all steps. Each step must have all three fields. -->

## Validation Checkpoints

<!-- Logical points where partial correctness can be verified -->
<!-- E.g., "After Step 3, the module should compile without errors." -->

| After Step | Checkpoint | How to Verify |
|------------|-----------|---------------|

## Risks

<!-- Known risks and their mitigations -->

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|

## Rollback Strategy

<!-- How to revert if implementation fails partway through -->
<!-- If N/A, state why: e.g., "Additive change only — no rollback needed." -->
